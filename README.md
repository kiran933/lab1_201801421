Functional Requirements:	 

Users should be able to login to their respective accounts.


Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online.

The user should be able to search the books based on the title, publication date, author. 


The system should be able to display the location of the searched book by the user.

	Non-functional Requirements: 
  

The system should be reliable enough to display the desired books of search  


The web page should be made using the recent HTML 5. 


The web page should be accessible only by using the institute LAN. 


The web page needs to be as secure as possible by allowing only authorized users to use the system and care should be taken as no confidential information (Ex: passwords) is stored in plain texts. 


The performance needs to be on point, making the results displayed in matter of seconds. 


The system should be scalable enough to support an extended number of users as the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with time. 


 

Scope: 


The system is an android application which helps people who are suffering from disabling hearing loss. Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from disabling hearing loss and this application creates an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs. This application will use artificial intelligence and recognize key sounds events like car horns and babies where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. 


	Features: 
  

This application should detect sounds desired by the user using artificial intelligence. 


The system should alert the user when it detects the sounds of the critical situation. 


The application should run using very low power and it needs to work real-time. 


	Non-Functional Requirements: 
  

This application is designed to be a mobile application. 


This app is optimized only for android users. 


This app is desired to have very low latency so that it works in real-time for use.
